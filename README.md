# Digital-Systems-Project

Project made for the course **EE206L: Digital Systems** under supervisor [**Dr. Sarvendranath Rimalpudi**](https://sarvendranath.in/).

### Rules:

#### Game:
1) A game should be designed with an objective to learn a digital systems concept taught  in the class.
2) A person who is not familiar with the concept should be able play the game and get the intuition
3) Rules of the game should be simple and clear.
4) Simple example should be provided.

#### Visual demonstration:
1) A visual demo or an interactive interface that helps to understand the digital systems concept should be developed
2) It can be an animation (gif) or any other form
3) Demo should be simple and clear for the audience to grasp the concept.
4) Any concept discussed in the class can be illustrated 

#### Competition:
1)  Evaluation will be based on i) Clarity of demo/game ii) Creativity and novelty involved.
2) Should not be copied from other sources. All the original source files used to create game/demo should be submitted. 
3) If the idea is inspired from another source, it should be mentioned clearly and novelty compared to the existing should be justified.

## The Game (CodeDiffuse)
### Rules:
1. A sequence of leds would be given which are essentially the responses to x,y states of (0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1).
2. You have to understand and formulate the function in term of minterms only.
3. Then, drag and drop gates at appropriate places and join the wires to produce the function on simulation.
4. Red and white leds would simulate the output you are producing. Make sure to check your answer before submitting.
5. You have a maximum of 5 tries to complete a level.
6. Make Sure to have fun and contact developers if you face any issue
7. Press W to start the game
   
#### Stage 1
1) Random 4 LED sequence (with only one led glowing) will be provided 
2) User will have to select any 2/3 input gate from AND.OR,NOT,XOR,XNOR and then select the inputs to these gates by toggling the switches for respective blocks.

#### Stage 2
1) Random 4 LED sequence (with two leds glowing) will be provided 
2) User will have to select any 2/3 input gate from AND.OR,NOT,XOR,XNOR and then select the inputs to these gates by toggling the switches for respective blocks.

#### Stage 3
1) Random 4 LED sequence (with three leds glowing) will be provided 
2) User will have to select any 2/3 input gate from AND.OR,NOT,XOR,XNOR and then select the inputs to these gates by toggling the switches for respective blocks.
