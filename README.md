## Rules

### Game

1. Design a game with the objective to teach a digital systems concept from the class.
2. Make the game accessible to those unfamiliar with the concept.
3. Keep the rules simple and clear.
4. Provide a simple example for better understanding.

### Visual Demonstration

1. Develop a visual demo or an interactive interface to explain digital systems concepts.
2. Use animations (GIF) or any other form to create a clear and simple demo.
3. Illustrate any concept discussed in the class.
4. Ensure clarity, simplicity, and audience-friendly demonstrations.

### Competition

1. Evaluation based on clarity of the demo/game and the creativity involved.
2. Originality is crucial; submitted original source files used to create the game/demo are required.
3. If inspired by another source, provide clear attribution and justify the novelty compared to existing works.

## The Game (CodeDiffuse)

### Rules

1. Given a sequence of LEDs representing responses to (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1) states.
2. Formulate the function in terms of minterms.
3. Drag and drop gates, connect wires to produce the function in simulation.
4. Red and white LEDs simulate the output; validate your answer before submitting.
5. You have a maximum of 5 tries to complete each level.
6. Have fun! Contact developers if you face any issues.
7. Press W to start the game.

### Levels

- **Level 1**
  - Random 4 LED sequence (with only one LED glowing) provided.
  - Select any 2/3 input gate (AND, OR, NOT, XOR, XNOR) and set inputs by toggling switches.

- **Level 2**
  - Random 4 LED sequence (with two LEDs glowing) provided.
  - Select any 2/3 input gate (AND, OR, NOT, XOR, XNOR) and set inputs by toggling switches.

- **Level 3**
  - Random 4 LED sequence (with three LEDs glowing) provided.
  - Select any 2/3 input gate (AND, OR, NOT, XOR, XNOR) and set inputs by toggling switches.
